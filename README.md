# CAP-m7G

**Motivation: **N7-Methlguanosine (m7G) modifications are critical for RNA stability, mRNA export, and protein translation, and are closely linked to ribosome function and gene expression regulation. Aberrations in m7G have been associated with diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, where loss of m7G leads to genomic instability and abnormal cell proliferation. Accurate identification of m7G sites is thus vital for understanding these mechanisms, yet current methods lack sufficient accuracy and generalizability.

**Results:** We developed CAP-m7G, a novel model integrating Chaos Game Representation and Capsule Networks, which achieved a precision of 96.63\%, specificity of 95.07\%, and MCC of 0.933 on independent test data. These results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing methods, establishing CAP-m7G as the state-of-the-art approach for m7G site identification.
